When texting or tweeting, it's not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally 
called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with 
all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

def main():
    text = input("Input: ")
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"

    result = ""

    for char in text:
        if char not in vowels:
            result += char

    print("Output:", result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
